# IEEE Motor Vehicles Challenge (MVC) 2025 installation instructions

## Preparations
- Make a local clone of the GIT repository https://github.com/VTSociety/MVC_2025 or download the entire project.
- To facilitate operating with git, a helpful tool for Windows is e.g. [Tortoise GIT](https://tortoisegit.org/) but there are several other [Git GUI Clients](https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis) available. Please note that the use of Git is not mandatory.
- It is required to have **Matlab Version R2022b** (tested). If you use a different version, please check the compatibility of the Simulink model with the 2022b version. The final evaluation will be carried out with Matlab R2022b

## Setup test
You can run tests with the "baseline EMS policy". To execute the Simulink model, please run the script "main_runSimulation.m":
- this script will define some parameters of the system;
- the mission profile will be selected according to the User's choice;
- it is possible to select whether the figures will be left open or closed after the simulation;
- at the end of the simulation, an autogenerated report will summarize the performance of the EMA;
Do not worry if the Simulink file does not show up: the script will run the simulation in the background. Alternatively, you can open the Simulink model and run it manually provided that the necessary parameters are set.

## Setup your own EMS
- To run the Simulink model, save the model after the modification and run the main script "main_runSimulation.m" again.
- Evaluate your EMS by checking the generated "ResultsVTSChallenge2025.html"

Good luck!
