# MVC_2025
Repository of the 2025 IEEE VTS Motor Vehicle Challenge (MVC)

## Introduction
![VPPC2024_MVC2025_Fig01c](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3058258b-4cb9-44c9-a135-982c7fad2200)

The topic of the challenge is to develop an <mark>Energy Management System</mark> (EMS) for a tugboat application. The tugboat powertrain consists of a dual-three phase permanent magnet synchronous motor where each of the two three phase windings are fed by a three phase inverter. The power source of each inverter is different, that is the following two energy sources are employed:
* a battery pack (BP)
* a supercapacitor module (SM)

The participants to the challenge will operate only in the EMS block provided within the simulation file. All the remaining blocks must not be modified. <ins>The final evaluation will be carried out by implementing the EMS block developed by each participant in the original simulation file</ins>. That is, <mark>all the modifications made in subsystems which are not the EMS one will be discarded</mark>. 

## Release Notes
Please refer to the change log.

Remarks:
* Please take notice of the [Discussion board](https://github.com/VTSociety/MVC_2025/discussions) for Q&A. Start a new discussion if you've found no answer to your issue. No answers will be given to questions related the MVC 2025 by private emails.
